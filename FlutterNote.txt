#### 
first main.dart setup
####

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const App());
}

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  const App({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GoMoon',
      theme: ThemeData(
        scaffoldBackgroundColor: Color.fromRGBO(31, 31, 31, 1.0),
      ),
      home: Scaffold(),
    ); // endMaterialApp
  }
}


#### 
the next thing is to delete the ^test^ folder in the root folder because we dont need it 
####


####
next create a folder called ^pages^ in the ^lib^ folder and then another file called ^home_page.dart^ in the ^pages^ folder
####


####
then in the home_page.dart file create

        ^import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

        class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
            const HomePage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

            @override
            Widget build(BuildContext context) {
                return Scaffold();
            }
        }^
####



####
then link the ^home_page.dart^ file to main.dart using either of this two method
1. change the ^home: Scafford()^ to ^home: HomePage()^ and it will automatically import the ^home_page.dart^ to ^main.dart^ if it didnt work try 2
2. after line 1 ^import 'package:flutter/material.dart';^  press  ^import './pages/home_page.dart';^ into line 2 to import it and its done  
####


####
now for assets like images,  create a folder called ^assets^ in the root folder then create another folder for images ^images^
